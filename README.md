list of AI vocabulary words 
This is a list of vocabulary words I've come across as I work through various online "classes" about Artificial Intelligence. Writing down "new" words helps me to learn and understand. And I will use as a reference down the line. 
I thought I'd share this list with the community as reference.
The words and definitions come from the following:
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence by Doug Rose via LinkedIn Learning (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence/why-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence)
AI for Beginners - from Microsoft - https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners/
