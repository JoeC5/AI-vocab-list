# AI-vocab-list

This is a list of vocabulary words I've come across as I work through various online "classes" about Artificial Intelligence. Writing down "new" words and their definitions help me to learn and understand. And I will use as a reference down the line. 
I thought I'd share this list with the community as reference.
The words and definitions come from the following:

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence by Doug Rose via LinkedIn Learning (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence/why-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence)

AI for Beginners - from Microsoft - https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners/

AI for Anyone (website) - https://www.aiforanyone.org/glossary/semantic-network

Please don't hesitate to add words and definitions.
